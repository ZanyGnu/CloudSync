CloudSync
=========
Allows downloading all picasa photos from a configured user account to a directory.
  Modify the app.config with the username and destination path to put the files.
Albums are created as directories, with photos under them.
Photos are downloaded in their original size.
Video files are invalid as Google Data API's and Picasa API's dont yet allow downloading original video files.
